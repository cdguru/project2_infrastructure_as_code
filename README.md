Hello 👋, 

This repo is part of my second posted project, you can see my other projects here 👉 [medium.com](https://medium.com/@cristian.dente).

The walkthrough of this project is on [this link](https://medium.com/@cristian.dente/3-tier-serverless-app-using-aws-api-gateway-aws-lambda-and-aws-dynamodb-cicd-and-terraform-ad20b459ca9c).

This repo contains all the terraform IaC code and [this other repo](https://github.com/cdguru/project2_lambda), contains the lambda code used to query the data in dynamodb. This last repo is called in the [terraform.tfvars](terraform/terraform.tfvars) file. All the details in the medium.com post ☝️.
